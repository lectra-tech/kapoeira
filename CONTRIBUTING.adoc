== Introduction

You can contribute to https://github.com/lectra-tech/kapoeira[Kapoeira^] via
https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/[pull requests^] filed.

== Workflow for a contributor
* Create a fork, named `kapoeira`, on your namespace : copy the `main` branch only
* Enable Github actions on this new repository for local ci operations : https://github.com/<your-namespace>/kapoeira/actions[^]
* Do your changes in the code!
* If your modifications are on the `main` branch, link:.github/workflows/docker-publish-when-release.yml[] is launched : unit & integration tests
* If you create a https://semver.org/[SemVer^] Github release, like `vX.Y.Z`, link:.github/workflows/docker-publish-when-release.yml[] is launched again, completed with a docker image publishing on ghcr.io

.Get your new Docker image for more tests on your side
[source,bash]
----
docker pull ghcr.io/<your-namespace>/kapoeira:<X.Y.Z>
----

* Create a pull request on this repository and on its `main` branch : link:.github/workflows/docker-contrib.yml[] is launched : unit & integration tests
* If a Kapoeira maintainer accepts this pull request and make a new release `vA.B.C`, your code will be available in the future Docker image on docker.io (https://hub.docker.com/r/lectratech/kapoeira/tags[DockerHub^])

.Get a Kapoeira Docker image having version A.B.C
[source,bash]
----
docker pull lectratech/kapoeira:<A.B.C>
----

NOTE: `latest` version is also available

== Signing off each Commit

As part of filing a pull request we ask you to sign off the
https://developercertificate.org/[Developer Certificate of Origin^] (DCO) in each commit.
Any Pull Request with commits that are not signed off will be reject by the
https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/[DCO check^].

A DCO is lightweight way for a contributor to confirm that they wrote or otherwise have the right
to submit code or documentation to a project. Simply add `Signed-off-by` as shown in the example below
to indicate that you agree with the DCO.

Example for a commit message with a sign-off:

[source]
----
    doc(readme.adoc): Align sample code

    Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
----

Git has the `-s` option (lower case) for `commit` that can sign off a commit for you, see example below:

[source,bash]
----
git commit -s -m 'doc(readme.adoc): Align sample code'
----
